<h1> Explain Terms Because Im Lazy <h2>


<h2> Introduction <h4>

Tame the legalese beast with this Python script! Powered by OpenAI's GPT, it expertly condenses even the most extensive terms and conditions into concise, user-friendly summaries. Ideal for the time-pressed, the efficiency-minded, and those who simply prefer to skip the legalese, this tool empowers you to grasp key points quickly and accurately. Reclaim your time, embrace understanding, and procrastinate with confidence â€“ clarity is just a click away.

<h2> How It Works <h4>

The script offers a user-friendly interface, requiring only your OpenAI key and the text you want to simplify. With a single function call, it automates the entire process:

Text Extraction: Seamlessly extracts content from the designated text file.

Intelligent Segmentation: Divides the text into logical sections for focused summarization.

GPT-Powered Summarization: Utilizes OpenAI's GPT model and tailored prompts to generate concise and accurate summaries.

Terms and Conditions Mastery: Expertly handles terms and conditions documents, crafting comprehensive yet digestible summaries.

Length Management: Ensures clarity by shortening summaries that exceed 800 characters.

<h2> GPT Model Choice <h4>

Both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 produce similar results. However, although GPT-3.5 is cheaper, GPT-4 more accurately summarizes the text. Each generated code costs less than a tenth of a dollar and is produced in less than 1 minute. To save money, a free alternative would be to use the prompts from the [src/etbil.py](etbil.py) file in ChatGPT. However, this method requires manual intervention and is not automatic.
